This is the main "presentation" file in the package. Presentation is
in quotes because there is absolutely no CSS in the project, and gives
the user hardly any direction. That's because I have no idea what your
site looks like, nor how you want to introduce it to your visitors. So
that's up to you. But this is all the skeleton html of the project.
